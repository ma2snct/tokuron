This paper presents the concept about a web application
which can share healthcare information between patients and doctors.
Healthcare information is not shared between patients and doctors
in Japan
because the standard for healthcare information systems
is not arranged.

It is waste for patients and doctors to carry out inspections
to get  the same information which patients did.
If it isn't done, patients and doctors can save medical cost.
Accordingly, it need to develop a sharing web application can receive some different format document.

This study supposes that CSV format and HL7 format documents
are input documents.
Because some hospitals mainly supplying
primary care use Excel instead of healthcare information system.
And other hospital supplying surgery use the system.
it can output data in HL7 format.
Thereby, it can let hospitals share healthcare information.

The information is managed on CouchDB,
and assigned keys.
Keys are made from different formats.
So, some words are used as same semantic keys.
And, the same semantic keys are connected
to use as the same semantic data.
Therefore, the application can search information
that have same mean even if information made from different software.

This application using NoSQL can collect healthcare information
which is written in some format.
If the function which arrange data are added,
this application can show visualize data as well.
